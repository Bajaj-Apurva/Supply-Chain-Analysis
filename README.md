# Supply-Chain-Analysis
This project performs a comprehensive analysis of supply chain data to uncover insights about product performance, revenue generation, shipping costs, defect rates, and more. The analysis is performed using Python with data visualization libraries like Plotly to present the findings in an interactive and informative manner.

## **Introduction**
Supply Chain Analysis is a critical aspect of managing the flow of goods and services from suppliers to customers. This project focuses on analyzing key aspects of the supply chain, including sales by product type, revenue by shipping carrier, manufacturing costs, defect rates, and more. The goal is to provide actionable insights to improve efficiency and profitability.

## **Dataset**
The dataset used for this analysis, supply_chain_data.csv, contains the following columns:

SKU: Stock Keeping Unit identifier.

Product type: Type of product.

Price: Price of the product.

Availability: The availability status of the product, indicating whether the product is in stock or out of stock.

Number of products sold: The total number of units sold for a particular product.

Revenue generated: The total revenue generated from the sale of the product.

Customer demographics: Information about the demographics of the customers who purchased the product, such as age, gender, location, etc.

Stock levels: The quantity of stock available for the product at any given time.

Lead times: The amount of time it takes from when an order is placed until it is delivered.

Order quantities: The quantity of products ordered in a specific order or set of orders.

Shipping times: The duration of time taken to ship the product from the warehouse to the customer.

Shipping carriers: The companies responsible for delivering the product to the customer (e.g., FedEx, UPS, etc.).

Shipping costs: The cost associated with shipping the product to the customer.

Supplier name: The name of the supplier providing the product.

Location: The geographical location where the product is manufactured, stored, or shipped from.

Lead time: (Duplicated column) The amount of time it takes from when an order is placed until it is delivered.

Production volumes: The quantity of products produced within a specific time frame.

Manufacturing lead time: The time taken to manufacture the product from start to finish.

Manufacturing costs: The cost incurred in the process of manufacturing the product.

Inspection results: The outcomes of quality checks conducted on the products, which may indicate pass or fail.

Defect rates: The percentage of products that were found to be defective during inspection or post-sale.

Transportation modes: The mode of transportation used to move the product from one location to another (e.g., air, sea, road, etc.).

Routes: The specific transportation routes used to deliver the product.

Costs: The total costs associated with transportation and logistics, including fuel, labor, and other operational expenses.

## **Analysis and Visualizations**
#### **Exploratory Data Analysis**
The project begins with basic exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset:

Descriptive Statistics: A summary of key statistics for numerical columns.

Data Visualization: Scatter plots, pie charts, bar charts, and line graphs to visually represent the data.

#### **Visualizations**

#### Price vs. Revenue Generated:
Scatter plot with a trendline showing the relationship between the price of products and the revenue generated, categorized by product type.

#### Sales by Product Type:
A pie chart displaying the distribution of sales by product type.

#### Total Revenue by Shipping Carrier:
A bar chart showing total revenue generated by different shipping carriers.

#### Average Lead Time and Manufacturing Costs:
A merged table displaying the average lead time and manufacturing costs for each product type.

#### Revenue by SKU:
A line chart showing revenue generated by each SKU.

#### Stock Levels by SKU:
A line chart displaying stock levels by SKU.

#### Order Quantity by SKU:
A bar chart showing the order quantities for each SKU.

#### Shipping Costs by Carrier:
A bar chart illustrating the shipping costs incurred by each carrier.

#### Cost Distribution by Transportation Mode:
A pie chart showing the distribution of costs across different transportation modes.

#### Average Defect Rates by Product Type:
A bar chart showing the average defect rates for each product type.

#### Defect Rates by Transportation Mode:
A pie chart displaying the distribution of defect rates across different transportation modes.

# **Conclusion**
This project provides a detailed analysis of various aspects of the supply chain, offering insights into product performance, revenue generation, cost efficiency, and defect rates. These insights can be used to optimize the supply chain, reduce costs, and increase profitability.
